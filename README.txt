These files are a compile of my patched version of PuTTY.

The "exe" files are Windows, the others are compiled for Debian Jessie.

The putty-src.zip file contains the source that was used for
this build including the Makefiles made by mkfiles.pl. Newlines
have been converted to CR-LF for dumb dos programs.
